Backend assignment


Hello,

Please find the following files with this submission:

1. PART_1_JSON_schema.js 
_This contains the Part 1 of the assignment._

I have tried to use Query Driven Design approach to design the schema and I have used referencing where-ever possible to avoid embedding and repeating re-occuring data. Though this schema can definitely be improved further or redesigned in a more efficient manner given more time and details.

2. PART_2_Psuedocodes.md
_This contains the functions of Part 2 of the assignment._
I used MongoDB as my reference database and have written the psuedocode keeping that in mind.I also ran mongodb shell commands on a locally created database for testing.

3. PART_3_Relational_schema.js
_This contains the Part 3 of the assignment._

4. README.md
