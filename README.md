Backend assignment


Hello,

Please find the following files with this submission:

1. JSON_schema.js 
_This contains the Part 1 of the assignment._

I have tried to use Query Driven Design approach to design the schema and I have used referencing whereever possible to avoid embedding and repeating re-occuring data. Though this schema can definitely be improved further or redesigned in a more efficient manner.

2. Psuedocodes.md
_This contains the functions of Part 2 of the assignment._
I used MongoDB as my reference database and have written the psuedocode keeping that in mind.

3. Additional_schema
_This contains the Part 3 of the assignment._

4. README.md
